# Bus-Fare-Calculator
Imagine coming to a new city where you need to use public transport (a bus in our case). How do you know which ticket to buy: a single ticket, a 7-day ticket, or 30day unlimited? Which tariff is cheaper? This program helps you to choose the cheapest tariff (depending on how many days you´re staying and how many trips you´re going to take) and it will also show you the price per ride. It is written in Java and it makes use of Arrays to calculate the best bus tariff.
